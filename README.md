# Yard Sale - CS50W - Project 2 Commerce

This project was developed to satisfy the requirements for CS50W Project 2 Commerce. 

Yard Sale is a Django web application that allows users to create auction listings, place bids, comment on listings, and interact with other users through messaging. In addition to meeting the project requirements, Yard Sale includes several advanced features and enhancements.

## Usage

### Optional -- Included Test Database
- A test database is included with sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.
- You must update the listing dates or else the auctions will all be closed. 
    - From github repo, be sure to include the db.sqlite3 file in the commerce directory.
    - Inside of commerce/auctions/views.py, uncomment the following lines: 
        - `# from . import maintenance`
        - `# maintenance.reset_database()`
    - Run the server and navigate to or refresh the index page.
    - Comment out the lines again and restart the server.
- Use django admin to view all users, if you want to access a user account the password is lowercase username and email is lowercase username '@email.com'.
- If you want to erase the bids, messages, comments, and transactions, you can use the admin interface to delete all objects of those types.


### Installation and startup
1. Install Django and required dependencies.
2. Clone the project repository.
3. Set up the database and run migrations. (Optional: use the included test database)
4. Run the Django development server.

## Auction Flow and Messaging

I wrote all this out to help me wrap my head around my own system and test all the automated actions. If you're curious about the inner workings of Yard Sale, read on!

### Placing Bids
- User clicks on the "Place Bid" button on the listing page.
- Form validation ensures the bid is higher than the current bid.
- User submits the form to place bid.
  - If there are less than 24 hours left on listing AND user has insufficient funds to cover the bid, the bid is rejected.
    - Message the bidder: `send_insufficient_funds_notification()`.
  - If the user has insufficient funds, but there are more than 24 hours left, the bid is accepted conditionally.
    - Message the bidder: `send_bid_success_message_low_funds()` -- includes time left to deposit funds.
    - Message the previous high bidder: `message_previous_high_bidder()`.
    - Message the seller: `send_bid_success_message_seller()`.
  - If the user has sufficient funds, the bid is accepted.
    - Message the bidder: `send_bid_success_message_bidder()`.
    - Message the previous high bidder: `message_previous_high_bidder()`.
    - Message the seller: `send_bid_success_message_seller()`.
- Update the listing with the new high bid.

### Closing Auctions

#### Close Auction Early (seller action)
- User clicks on the "Close Auction" button on the listing page.
- If there are less than 24 hours left, the auction cannot be closed early.
- If there are no active bids, the listing is closed immediately.
  - `listing.cancelled` set to True, `listing.active` set to False.
  - Message the seller: `notify_seller_closed_no_bids()`.
  - `helpers.charge_early_closing_fee()` -- 5% fee on listing price.
  - Message the seller: `send_early_closing_fee_message()` -- 5% fee on listing price.
    - If the seller has insufficient funds to cover the 5% fee when no bids are made:
      - Message seller: `send_fee_failure_message()`.
      - The seller has 7 days to deposit funds to cover the fee before additional fees begin to accrue.
      - This is checked by the task `check_user_fees()` which runs every 12 hours.
        - For each day beyond the 7 day grace period, the seller is charged an additional 5% fee on the listing price.
        - On day 28, a message is sent to the seller notifying them of imminent account deactivation and legal action: `send_account_closure_message()`.
        - After 30 days, the seller account is deactivated (password and username changed), and the issue is escalated to legal department/collections.

- If there ARE active bids, 24-hour delay before auction is closed, and bidders have 24 hours after closing to deposit funds into their account and submit to escrow before their bid is removed.
  - `listing.cancelled` set to True.
  - Message the seller and bidders: `notify_all_early_closing()` -- includes new closing date and fee notice for seller.

#### Auction Expiration (automated action)
- `tasks.set_inactive()`, runs every 60 seconds and is the main task for closing auctions.
  - Calls `helpers.declare_winner()`.
  - If `highest_bid.user.balance < highest_bid.amount`, `declare_winner()` returns without assigning a winner.
    - The recurring task `check_if_bids_funded()` runs every 15 minutes and will remove bids for listings 24 hours before closing if the listing was NOT closed early by the seller. If the listing IS closed early, `listing.cancelled` is set to True, and the new cutoff date for depositing sufficient funds is set to 24 hours after the early closing date.
  - `declare_winner()` will send messages to all bidders and the seller: `notify_all_closed_listing()`.
  - `declare_winner()` will initiate transfer to escrow w/ `helpers.transfer_to_escrow()`.
    - If the buyer balance < highest_bid.amount:
      - `a_msg.get_escrow_fail_message()` -- includes time left to deposit funds. Only relevant in cases where auction was not closed early by the seller.
    - Else:
      - `a_msg.get_escrow_success_message()` if escrow transfer succeeds.
  - If no bids, `notify_seller_closed_no_bids()`.

- If the automatic escrow transfer succeeds, the seller will have a button to confirm shipping that will appear on the listing's page.
- If the automatic escrow transfer fails, the winning bidder will have a button to transfer the funds to escrow that will appear on the listing's page. This action, `move_to_escrow()`, simply calls upon `helpers.transfer_to_escrow()` if the winner has sufficient funds.
- Confirm Shipping: When the buyer presses the confirm shipping button, the funds in escrow are transferred to the seller's account, minus the fee, which is transferred to the site account.
  - `helpers.transfer_to_seller()` handles money and transaction object creation.
  - `send_shipping_confirmation_messages()` to the buyer and seller, confirming successful transfer.
  - If escrow is empty when it should not be, admin alerted with message: `send_escrow_empty_alert_message()`.

#### Cancel Bids ####
  - User clicks on the "Cancel Bid" button on the listing page.
  - If the listing expires in less than 24 hours, the bid cannot be canceled.
  - If the canceled bid was the highest bid:
    - Determine new high bidder, send message to notify both parties:
      - `send_bid_cancelled_message_confirmation()`.
      - `send_bid_cancelled_message_new_high_bidder()`.
  - Get message template to seller to notify them of canceled bid depending on if there are more bids:
    - `get_bid_cancelled_message_seller_no_bids`.
    - `get_bid_cancelled_message_seller_bids`.
    - Send message and update listing.
  - The task `check_if_bids_funded()` runs every 15 minutes and will remove bids for listings 24 hours before closing if the listing was NOT closed early by the seller.
    - Message sent to the bidder who has bid removed: `send_bid_removed_message()`.

#### Withdraw Funds ####
  - User clicks on the "Withdraw Funds" button on the user's account page.
  - Users cannot overdraw their account intentionally from the front end.
  - If the user has insufficient funds, the withdrawal is rejected by the form.
  - If the user has active bids on any listings that are less than 24 hours from closing, they must keep a balance that can cover the bids for the expiring auctions.
    - If the withdraw would leave the user with insufficient funds to cover the bids, the withdrawal is rejected: `send_message_deny_withdrawal()`.
  - If the user has active bids on any listings that are closing in less than 72 hours, there are not constraints, but a message is sent to the user to notify of the time left and the amount of funds that should be kept in the account to cover the bids for upcoming closing auctions. The message also tells them which auction they bid on will be the first to close.
    - `send_message_withdrawal_72()`.
  - If no active bids or sufficient funds to cover the bids, the withdrawal is accepted:
    - `send_message_withdrawal_success()`.
    - Update user.balance, record transaction.
